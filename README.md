Let's start by creating the basic structure of the project. We will need the following files:

- `public/index.html`: This will be the main HTML file that will contain the structure of our quiz app.
- `public/main.js`: This will contain the JavaScript code for our quiz app.
- `public/style.css`: This will contain the CSS styles for our quiz app.
- `server.js`: This will be our Express server that will serve our static files.
- `package.json`: This will contain the metadata of our project like the project's dependencies.

Let's start by creating the `package.json` file. We will need `express` as a dependency.
